#  Why?
I'm kind of anal about balancing my bank account, knowing exactly how much I have and knowing that it's 100% accurate to the penny. My current process is years old and needed an update, and as with most projects I wanted to learn something new. Instead of doing it with Core Data (which frankly would have been much easier, at least from my perspective) I decided I wanted the ability to also have a web front-end at some point, so I decided to learn Firebase.

# It's kind of boring though right?
Yeah, I've basically stuck with standard iOS UI elements with the occasional flare of color. I slapped in a label framework just to try it out, I might just remove it later and roll my own solution. I have no intention of putting this on the App Store for public consumption though, so I might just leave it ugly for the time being because I'm stubborn. Definitely staying ugly while I try it out for a few weeks to see what's missing or where the bugs are. 

Oh you meant boring like "Why would someone want this?" I don't know, I just like balancing my checkbook and got sick of the way I do it currently, which involves a spreadsheet and math.

# What's next?
Next I guess is taking it for a spin for a while to see what must-have features I would really like to think about including before talking myself out of them. I also need to scrub the classes for better encapsulation and align the Firebase implementation with best practices (once I  have a better understanding of what those are).
